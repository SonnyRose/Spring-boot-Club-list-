# Spring MVC Club-list application
### Description  :
This is a project for finding entertainment 
and activities of any kind. 
With the possibility of registration, as well as keeping your data 
completely safe with password encryption. 
The user can create an activity (in the application it is
called Club), specifying a lot of additional data about the club,
as well as create an event for this club that corresponds 
to the theme of the service itself.
The project also includes mini-documentation inside
almost every file to make it easier for you to read the code, 
in the future, an English version will be added to this documentation,
but currently only Ukrainian is available. 
My project may look similar to other people's projects,
but that's only because I used ready-made html pages from Bootstrap.
